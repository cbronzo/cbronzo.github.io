This week, I built my own custom CLI Application that pulled data from an external website! Although I felt very confident and could finish it in just a few hours -- I grossly underestimaed how long it would take me for my first time! The building of it wasn't necessarily the hard part, the de-bugging was! I would fix one thing, and it would break another....or I would get so close to completion and then realize I need to refactor an entire set of code, and by doing that it would affect other related pices. Or, I was missing something as simple as a comma, and would spend forever grooming through the lines of code. Hah, I learned so much by building this CLI but mostly I learned about the actual process of coding, and how much more of a mental game it truly is.
