*Placeholder text, will finish today* The past few weeks (yes, weeks!) I have been working on my second portfolio project using Sinatra, the MVC model, CRUD & active record. I created an application that allows users to track the amount of states they have traveled to in the US. This was the first application I have made where a database stores information that a user inputs -- such as their login information, their user id, the states they have been to and even their favorite memory of that state. There were so many working parts to building this and each piece of my code related to another piece of my code, making it confusing at times, but even more exciting when it all connected correctly and worked!....
