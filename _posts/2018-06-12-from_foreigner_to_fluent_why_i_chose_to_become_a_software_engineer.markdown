Having traveled the world, I quickly learned how beneficial it would have been to have known other languages. I was naive to think that just knowing the English language would suffice. I surely regretted not paying more attention in Spanish class. Sure, I was able to communicate with gestures, translators and through the human experience, but had I known their native language — so many more doors would have opened, and I would have had a full view of their culture, not just a glimpse.

Although it’s still a goal to become multilingual, I've set my sights on a different kind of language: the language of computers. When I think to myself, how will I best be able to communicate with today’s technology-oriented world? And how can I ensure that I’ll be able to communicate with tomorrow’s ever-changing world? The answer is programming languages. I want to become multilingual in software programming because it is a necessity for understanding the world around us, and I never want to regret not being a part of it. As technology starts to encapsulate every aspect of our lives, I want to be able to communicate, interact and fully understand its capabilities. Like traveling, I no longer want to remain ignorant of languages, and so I chose Flatiron School to teach me the language of today. I will dive head-first into a brand new world with brand new languages, but I will not be a foreigner for long.


I chose to learn software development because it's a skill that can be applied to virtually every career and application of today. It's often a skill that impresses others as it's seemingly complicated nature scares others away. Rather than remaining fearful, I want to jump into this world fully and be a part of creating the future. Understanding computer programming will ensure that I have a say in my tomorrow, whilst also giving me the freedom to create, innovate and communicate my ideas through tech. Knowledge is truly power, and this knowledge is essential to understanding the world around us.

In addition to being necessary, it also gives certainty for a career, which relieves me of the “I’m figuring it out” pressure. The need for software developers is high, and the ability to create anything through my fingertips is assuring as well as beautiful. By pushing myself down this career path, I know I will never get a chance to stop learning, I will continue to expand my horizons and the opportunities will be endless. Like traveling, I want to better understand the world around me and sometimes to do that, you have to get off the sidelines and start playing the game, whatever that game may be. Ready, set, code!
